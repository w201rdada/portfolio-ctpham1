I am currently using Rstudio to display my ideas. Hope you enjoy and all feedback is welcome! Figure 2: Hello Benjamin Franklin! Abstract of Audio Wizard Audio Wizard looks to help music producers build better music. With the use of data science, Audio Wizard will build beats, melodies, and tones to provide an blueprint for the producer to put into production. Thousands of popular songs will be analyzed for various signature tones and will be processed to develop a unique melody that the world has never heard of. Eventually, Audio Wizard will create new genres by fusing different genres. Music will be redefined as we know it with Audio Wizard. Abstract of Balance Temple Balance Temple looks to help individuals who are experiencing muscle pains. It all starts with a device the user will wear that will provide a bioscan on key muscle groups that are weak and overcompensating. Balance Temple will process the data gathered to provide solutions to the user. Sedentary lifestyles are becoming more and more prevalent in the digital age. It is important that we ensure our muscle groups are still functional to prevent more serious issues down the line. Balance Temple will help people get ahead of the problem early.

["balance-temple-your-body-is-a-temple.html", "Balance Temple {#Your Body is a Temple} Sedentary. Pain Points. Pain Relief.", " Balance Temple {#Your Body is a Temple} Body, Mind, Health, Fitness, Pain-Free Sedentary. How did you get into that state of physical pain? If the answer is not caused by external factors, the pain is probably only caused by you! Having good fundamental movements is essential for humans to be healthy. In the today’s digital age, more and more jobs are becoming sedentary. Fundamental movements requires a balance of multiple areas of the body to work together. When your body does not have good fundamental balance, muscle groups begin to compensate for one another, often leading to pain and maybe even surgery down the line. Balance Temple looks to help every day people who care about their health by providing data on muscle groups that need improvement and provide rehabiliation exercises. Pain Points. If we were to take a specific example of the most common pain point faced by working adults, it would be lower back pain. Too often, adults will continue day after day, year after year, with the same lingering pain without trying to make it better until now, with Balance Temple. Balance Temple gives people access to the information they seek about their pain and how to solve it. The first step requires that we build a senor that an individual can strap to their body so their movements can be tracked. We would build out software that is embedded in the sensor to discover muscle groups that are overcompensating or in pain. Over time, Balance Temple would learn the user’s movement and provide exercises to improve weak areas. In extreme cases, Balance Temple would recommend to see a physician. Balance Temple will grab inputs or variables similar to the ones asked of you at a doctor’s office. These might include: age, weight, height, ethnicity, and etc. To maximize the benefit of Balance Temple, wearing it during rehab exercises is vital for monitoring your progress. Overtime, through many iterations, Balance Temple will begin to prescribe specific exercises depending on the stress levels of your muscle. Exercises will be targeted to also strengthen other areas of weakness but have focus on the specific pain point. Eventually, Balance Temple will be able to be so efficient that at any stage of recovery, there will be a specific exercises. Balance Temple will be able to learn all different types of human body characteristics, and be able to dissect specific exercises that are more beneficial for a specific body type. If we were to classify “back pain” as a type of pain, there are many other specific pain points that can also occur. Balance Temple will always look for other areas of improvement because the human body can never achieve perfect balance. Pain Relief. Balance Temple will help individuals get ahead of the curve and put a solution in their hands so they can help their body. Consumers would use Balance Temple to be proactive about their health. However, the task is extremely challenging and costly. Developing a device to track human movement to the precision of how much stress a muscle is feeling will be difficult. Furthermore, individuals using Balance Temple need to be aware that getting healthier is a process that requires effort and repetition. With that said, once an individual is committed, the foundation will be set to help individuals. Balance Temple will help people recover from lingering pains, help be less injury prone, and ultimately help live a healthier life. "],
["Majestic-Sound.html", "Audio Wizard The Revolution The Art of Sound The Future.", " Audio Wizard Keywords Music, Audiophile The Revolution What makes a pop song, or any song, popular and successful? Songs that are popular are catchy, unique, and tap into the unconscious mind. When you hear a pop song for the first time, you generally know who the performer is, think Taylor Swift or Justin Bieber. But how do listeners unconsciously recognize performers? How much significance is placed on the beat, melody, or genre? Audio Wizard looks to discover this relationship and help produce the best music. In the beginning discovering artists who are relatively unknown would be the most efficient to control costs. As the algorithm grows to become more complex and gain recognition, voice signatures will become an input and the melody, beat, and dynamics will generate on their own. Mainstream artists will want to team up with Audio Wizard. This will allow us to be in a strong position for negotiations. The Art of Sound The first step is to take songs that have been popular for years and dissect the underlying attributes of the song. This includes the tones, beat, melody, vocals, and instruments. We would segment our analysis based on one genre at first with the largest data sample. We know that different genres will have different characteristics that make them popular. We will find correlations between the songs within that genre and begin to build out a model to predict success for that specific genre. We expect that the melody or the beat is the strongest predictor of popularity, with the the voice and notes of the singer being significant but to a lesser extent. A powerful confounding variable is star power. Too often songs are popular just because they are sung by a mainstream artist who is established with star power. We want to try to minimize this to ensure no matter the song we want a record that will go platinum and be successful. Tones and sound can be broken down based on frequency of vibrations. Our algorithm will scan through submissions from artists to match the right voice to the sound. The artist will work with producers to develop the best lyrical delivery of the song. We will also analyze multiple genres and find ways to fuse genres to create new sounds that will galvanize listeners. This is similar to how techno and EDM are now fusing with pop culture to become more mainstream. The Future. Audio Wizard looks to help build songs that will be enjoyed by everyone. The goal is to build music in whatever genre to appeal to the masses. A limitation we will need to address is building songs that sound “generic” or too similar to the last song. In order to combat this, we need to build our algorithm to prevent certain tones to ensure uniqueness. Risks will be measured with a proven algorithm to help producers make the best music and it will also eliminate the unnecessary risks associated to an investment into a album production. Music is very subjective and that will be one of the biggest challenges for Audio Wizard. There are so many variables outside the production process that can be considered, but we have to start somewhere. Audio Wizard will redefine the bar of making music and build songs that will be celebrated. "]
