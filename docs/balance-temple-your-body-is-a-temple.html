<p>How did you get into that state of physical pain? If the answer is not caused by external factors, the pain is probably only caused by you! Having good fundamental movements is essential for humans to be healthy. In the today’s digital age, more and more jobs are becoming sedentary. Fundamental movements requires a balance of multiple areas of the body to work together. When your body does not have good fundamental balance, muscle groups begin to compensate for one another, often leading to pain and maybe even surgery down the line. Balance Temple looks to help every day people who care about their health by providing data on muscle groups that need improvement and provide rehabiliation exercises.</p>
</div>
<div id="pain-points." class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Pain Points.</h2>
<p>If we were to take a specific example of the most common pain point faced by working adults, it would be lower back pain. Too often, adults will continue day after day, year after year, with the same lingering pain without trying to make it better until now, with Balance Temple. Balance Temple gives people access to the information they seek about their pain and how to solve it.</p>
<p>The first step requires that we build a senor that an individual can strap to their body so their movements can be tracked. We would build out software that is embedded in the sensor to discover muscle groups that are overcompensating or in pain. Over time, Balance Temple would learn the user’s movement and provide exercises to improve weak areas. In extreme cases, Balance Temple would recommend to see a physician. Balance Temple will grab inputs or variables similar to the ones asked of you at a doctor’s office. These might include: age, weight, height, ethnicity, and etc.</p>
<p>To maximize the benefit of Balance Temple, wearing it during rehab exercises is vital for monitoring your progress. Overtime, through many iterations, Balance Temple will begin to prescribe specific exercises depending on the stress levels of your muscle. Exercises will be targeted to also strengthen other areas of weakness but have focus on the specific pain point. Eventually, Balance Temple will be able to be so efficient that at any stage of recovery, there will be a specific exercises. Balance Temple will be able to learn all different types of human body characteristics, and be able to dissect specific exercises that are more beneficial for a specific body type. If we were to classify “back pain” as a type of pain, there are many other specific pain points that can also occur. Balance Temple will always look for other areas of improvement because the human body can never achieve perfect balance.</p>

<div id="pain-relief." class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Pain Relief.</h2>
<p>Balance Temple will help individuals get ahead of the curve and put a solution in their hands so they can help their body. Consumers would use Balance Temple to be proactive about their health. However, the task is extremely challenging and costly. Developing a device to track human movement to the precision of how much stress a muscle is feeling will be difficult. Furthermore, individuals using Balance Temple need to be aware that getting healthier is a process that requires effort and repetition. With that said, once an individual is committed, the foundation will be set to help individuals. Balance Temple will help people recover from lingering pains, help be less injury prone, and ultimately help live a healthier life.</p>
