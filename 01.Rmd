## The Revolution.

What makes a pop song popular and successful? What makes any song popular and successful? Songs that are popular are catchy, unique, and tap into the unconscious mind. When you hear a pop song for the first time, you generally know (think Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, etc). How much significance is placed on the beat, melody, or genre? Audio Wizard looks to discover this relationship and help produce the best music. 

## The Art of Sound.

The first step is to take songs that have been popular for years and dissect the underlying attributes of the song. This could include the underlying tones, the beat, the vocals, instruments, and etc. We would segment our analysis based on one genre at first with the largest data sample. We will find correlations between the songs within that genre and begin to build out a model to predict success for that specific genre.Our method will emphasize the melody or the beat as the primary objective of the song. The voice and notes of the singer will be significant. Too often songs are popular just because they are sung by a mainstream artist who is established with star power. We want to try to minimize this to ensure no matter the song we want a record that will go platinum and be successful. 

Our algorithm will scan through submissions from artists to match the right voice to the sound. The artist will work with producers to develop the best lyrical delivery of the song. In the beginning discovering artists who are relatively unknownwould be the most efficient to control costs. As the algorithm grows to become more complex and gain recognition, voicesignatures will become an input and the melody, beat, and dynamics will generate on their own. Main stream artistswill want to team up with Audio Wizard. This will allow us to be in a strong position for negotiations.

We know that different genres will have different characteristics that make them popular. However, tones and sound can be broken down based on frequency of vibrations. We will also analyze multiple genres and find ways to fuse genres to create new sounds that will galvanize listeners. This is similar to how techno and EDM are now fusing with pop culture to become more mainstream. 

## The Future.

Audio Wizard looks to help build songs that will be enjoyed by everyone. The goal is to build music in whatever genre to appeal to the masses. A limitation we will need to address isbuilding songs that sound "generic" or too similar to the last song. In order to combat this, we need to build our algorithm to prevent certain tones to ensure uniqueness. Risks will be measured with a proven algorithm to help producers make the best music and it will also eliminate the unnecessary risks associated to an investment into a album production. Music is very subjective and that will be one of the biggest challenges for Audio Wizard. There are so many variables outside the production process that can be considered, but we have to start somewhere. Audio Wizard will redefine the bar of making music and build songs that will be celebrated.
